# Portfolio
Some programming projects that I have been working on in class and in
my spare time.

# JavaProjects
These are some Java programs that were suggested in the Programming 
Projects sections of Java Software Solutions by Lewis & Loftus.

BarGraph.jar is a graphical user interface that draws a bar graph
with several bars of random height.

Keypad.jar is a graphical user interface containing number buttons, a 
clear button, and an enter button. At the top of the window, the 
numbers that the user has clicked are displayed. The clear button 
clears the display. The enter button doesn't do anyting.

MorphingCircle.jar (WARNING! FLASHING COLOURS!) is an interactive 
graphics program with a coloured circle in the centre. The circle changes 
colour depending on which quadrant the mouse cursor is in. 
WARNING: flashing colours!

# WebDevelopmentProjects
These are some HTML5 website designs that I have made.

siteprototype is a website prototype using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and
PHP that I worked on during COMP 1536. We were given the site 
requirements, wireframe diagram, and images, and we built the website
from there. To see the PHP in action, please

labquiz is a website that I built in my COMP 1536 lab. I had 1 hour,
50 minutes to build a website consisting of a home page, about us page,
and a contact us page that looked like the instructor's screenshots. We
were given the images, PHP for the form, and the HTML for the home page.
