**siteprototype** is a website prototype using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and
PHP that I worked on during COMP 1536. We were given the site 
requirements, wireframe diagram, and images, and we built the website
from there. To see the PHP in action, please

**labquiz** is a website that I built in my COMP 1536 lab. I had 1 hour,
50 minutes to build a website consisting of a home page, about us page,
and a contact us page that looked like the instructor's screenshots. We
were given the images, PHP for the form, and the HTML for the home page.
