# Portfolio
Some programming projects that I have been working on in class and in
my spare time.

## Calendar
A very lightweight calendar written in JavaScript.

## JavaProjects
These are some Java programs that were suggested in the Programming 
Projects sections of Java Software Solutions by Lewis & Loftus.

**BarGraph.jar** is a graphical user interface that draws a bar graph
with several bars of random height.

**Keypad.jar** is a graphical user interface containing number buttons, a 
clear button, and an enter button. At the top of the window, the 
numbers that the user has clicked are displayed. The clear button 
clears the display. The enter button doesn't do anyting.

**RockPaperScissors.jar** is an interactive game of rock-paper-scissors
between the user and the computer.

## WebDevelopmentProjects
These are some HTML5 website designs that I have made.

**madeleines** is a term project that I built with 3 of my classmates in
COMP 1536. It is a website for a fictional patisserie named Madeleine's.

**siteprototype** is a website prototype using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and
PHP that I worked on during COMP 1536. We were given the site 
requirements, wireframe diagram, and images, and we built the website
from there. To see the PHP in action, please

**labquiz** is a website that I built in my COMP 1536 lab. I had 1 hour,
50 minutes to build a website consisting of a home page, about us page,
and a contact us page that looked like the instructor's screenshots. We
were given the images, PHP for the form, and the HTML for the home page.
